# Rubiks-Cube-Solver-BeginnersMethod

This is my first large programing project.

The goal of this project was to make the computer solve a 3x3 rubiks cube using a modified beginners method the same way most humans learn to solve a rubiks cube 
not the most optimal solution.

It will ask the user to input what each side looks like and it will output the moves that the user will need to make to solve the cube.
